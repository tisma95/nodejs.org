# Node.js Website Translation Policy

Node.js is a global platform and so this site has many translations. We use [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com) to translate the Node.js Website

The translation of the site into languages other than English is handled by [Crowdin translators](https://support.crowdin.com/translation-process-overview/).

## How to translate

1. Request to join the [Nodejs-Website in Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/nodejs-website)
2. [Select the language you want to translate](https://support.crowdin.com/joining-translation-project/#starting-translation)
3. [Start translating](https://support.crowdin.com/online-editor/)

### Any questions or feedbacks on Translations

If you have any questions or feedbacks on current translations, you can [start a discussion](https://crowdin.com/project/nodejs-website/discussions) by choosing the "New Topic" and your language from the right dropdown, or a [conversation](https://support.crowdin.com/conversations/) by adding your translators.

## How to add a new language

Go on `/i18n/config.json` and add the new language to the `locales` array.

Fill the language object with the following fields:

```json
{
  "code": "fr",
  "localName": "Français",
  "name": "French",
  "langDir": "ltr",
  "dateFormat": "DD.MM.YYYY",
  "hrefLang": "fr",
  "enabled": true
}
```

| Field Name   | Description                                                                                            | Examples     |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------ |
| `code`       | The language code. It must be the same as the folder name                                              | `fr`         |
| `localName`  | The language name in its own language (it's use in language selector)                                  | `Français`   |
| `name`       | The language name in English                                                                           | `French`     |
| `langDir`    | The direction of the language. `ltr` for left to right, `rtl` for right to left                        | `ltr`        |
| `dateFormat` | The date format. It must be a valid [moment.js format](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/format/) | `DD.MM.YYYY` |
| `hrefLang`   | The language code in [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) format         | `fr`         |
| `enabled`    | If the language is enabled or not                                                                      | `true`       |

Please also add the new locale file to the locales folder `/i18n/locales` and import it in the `/i18n/locales/index.mjs` file.

## Adding new Translation Keys

If you're making a new Component and adding Translation Keys for your Component, they should follow these guidelines:

- Only add the new translation keys on the `i18n/locales/en.json` file. Crowdin will handle on syncing the files and letting translators know there are new keys to be translated
- The translation keys should have the prefix as the canonical path of your Component. If your Component is `components/Common/MyComponent` the prefix key should be `components.common.myComponent`
  - The Translation Key suffix should be easy to understand and semantic. For example, if the key is about "the text of a button that when interacted it copies content to the clipboard", the suffix should probably be `copyButton.title`. The final translation key would be `components.common.myComponent.copyButton.title`
  - Translation Keys should be in Camel Case only.
  - The values of each Translation Key should follow the [ICU Message Syntax](https://formatjs.io/docs/core-concepts/icu-syntax/)
- All new Translation keys should be added at the bottom of the `i18n/locales/en.json` file. Since this makes it easier for Translators to notice that there are new Translation keys to be translated.

### Translations and Unit Testing

Translation Keys should not be translated during Unit Testing. If your Component uses, for example `FormattedMessage`, you should provide the `<IntlProvider>` surrounding your `testing-library` render logic, or you can create a wrapper for your test. Note that you should not import the English messages to your Unit Test as:

- Unit Testing should test a Component functionality.
- Unit Tests should not rely on text, titles, or string bags, as these texts will change arbitrarily and make the test suite fail.
  - In this case, you should test your component by aria-text, or other `aria-*` attributes or even by class names or other artifacts.
- If you want to test how different languages and text appear within a Component, Visual Regression Testing is recommended.
