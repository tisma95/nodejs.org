## _(Update 09-August-2023)_ Security releases available

Updates are now available for the v16.x, v18.x, and v20.x Node.js release lines for the
following issues.

## Permissions policies can be bypassed via `Module._load` (HIGH)(CVE-2023-32002)

The use of `Module._load()` can bypass the policy mechanism and require modules outside of the policy.json
definition for a given module.

Please note that at the time this CVE was issued, the policy mechanism is an experimental feature of Node.js.

Impacts:

- This vulnerability affects all users using the experimental policy mechanism in all active release
  lines: 16.x, 18.x and, 20.x.

Thank you, to mattaustin for reporting this vulnerability and thank you [Rafael Gonzaga](https://github.com/RafaelGSS)
and [Bradley Farias](https://twitter.com/bradleymeck) for fixing it.

## Permission model bypass by specifying a path traversal sequence in a Buffer (HIGH)(CVE-2023-32004)

A vulnerability has been discovered in Node.js version 20, specifically within the experimental permission model.
This flaw relates to improper handling of Buffers in file system APIs causing a traversal path to bypass when
verifying file permissions.

Please note that at the time this CVE was issued, the permission model is an experimental feature of Node.js.

Impacts:

- This vulnerability affects all users using the experimental permission model in Node.js 20.

Thank you, to Axel Chong for reporting this vulnerability and thank you [Rafael Gonzaga](https://github.com/RafaelGSS)
for fixing it.

## `process.binding()` can bypass the permission model through path traversal (HIGH)(CVE-2023-32558)

The use of the deprecated API `process.binding()` can bypass the permission model through path traversal.

Please note that at the time this CVE was issued, the permission model is an experimental feature of Node.js.

Impacts:

- This vulnerability affects all users using the experimental permission model in Node.js 20.

Thank you to [Rafael Gonzaga](https://github.com/RafaelGSS) for reporting and fixing this vulnerability.

## Permissions policies can impersonate other modules in using `module.constructor.createRequire()` (MEDIUM)(CVE-2023-32006)

The use of `module.constructor.createRequire()` can bypass the policy mechanism and require modules outside of the
policy.json definition for a given module.

Please note that at the time this CVE was issued, the policy mechanism is an experimental feature of Node.js.

Impacts:

- This vulnerability affects all users using the experimental policy mechanism in all active release
  lines: 16.x, 18.x and, 20.x.

Thank you, to Axel Chong for reporting this vulnerability and thank you [Rafael Gonzaga](https://github.com/RafaelGSS)
and [Bradley Farias](https://twitter.com/bradleymeck) for fixing it.

## Permissions policies can be bypassed via `process.binding` (MEDIUM)(CVE-2023-32559)

The use of the deprecated API `process.binding()` can bypass the policy mechanism by requiring internal modules
and eventually take advantage of `process.binding('spawn_sync')` run arbitrary code, outside of the
limits defined in a `policy.json` file.

Please note that at the time this CVE was issued, the policy is an experimental feature of Node.js.

Impacts

- This vulnerability affects all users using the experimental policy mechanism in all active release
  lines: 16.x, 18.x and, 20.x.

Thank you, to LeoDog896 for reporting this vulnerability and thank you [Tobias Nie√üen](https://github.com/tniessen)
for fixing it.

## `fs.statfs` can retrive stats from files restricted by the Permission Model (LOW)(CVE-2023-32005)

A vulnerability has been identified in Node.js version 20, affecting users of the experimental permission model when the `--allow-fs-read` flag is used with a non-`*` argument.

This flaw arises from an inadequate permission model that fails to restrict file stats through the `fs.statfs` API.
As a result, malicious actors can retrieve stats from files that they do not have explicit read access to.

Please note that at the time this CVE was issued, the permission model is an experimental feature of Node.js.

Impacts:

- This vulnerability affects all users using the experimental permission model in Node.js 20.

Thank you to [Rafael Gonzaga](https://github.com/RafaelGSS) for reporting and fixing this vulnerability.

## `fs.mkdtemp()` and `fs.mkdtempSync()` are missing `getValidatedPath()` checks (LOW)(CVE-2023-32003)

`fs.mkdtemp()` and `fs.mkdtempSync()` can be used to bypass the permission model check using a path traversal attack.
This flaw arises from a missing check in the `fs.mkdtemp()` API and the impact is a malicious actor could create an
arbitrary directory.

Please note that at the time this CVE was issued, the permission model is an experimental feature of Node.js.

Impacts:

- This vulnerability affects all users using the experimental permission model in Node.js 20.

Thank you, to Axel Chong for reporting this vulnerability and thank you [Rafael Gonzaga](https://github.com/RafaelGSS)
for fixing it.
